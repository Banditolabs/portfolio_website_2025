## What am I doing here?

This is my first time writing for the internet.

My goal for this blog is to serve as a place for me to reflect share what I'm working on and share what I've learned.
I don't know where this will go, but I know that out of all the work I've done in my life, coding is what feels like home. This blog will be a place for me to share that with you, dear reader. My primary goal is to share technical findings and insights through my work, with a sprinkle of my personality and the human condition.

Recently I've been laid off from work, it's been... well a disaster but you know, silver linings are where angels live. So here I am, writing this blog, the product of one silver lining I'm taking out of this period in my life. I'm coding up a project that makes me happy.

I was happy in my previous position. I was working my butt off every day, always feeling like a workout at the end of the day. Sometimes questioning, did I do good enough? Mentally I often felt just out of a boxing match. That's where I love to live though. In the end with a win under my belt, tired and battered but victorious.

I've soaked up so mucn experience and knowledge looking back at where I was in November of 2022.

I know I've put everything I had into my work, and I'm proud of that.

## Where I'm at now

Now, I have the time to double down on my existing coding skills and learn new ones. Networking and attempting to make myself marketable in a sea of laid-off talent is how I spend most of my time.
I've got two years of solid experience with **Ruby on Rails, React, Javascript, and SQL**. You can find other mainstream experience on my resume, those are the main culprits.

It just so happens the market really doesn't need anyone with only two years of experience. At least not a very large segment of the market. So dear blog reader, we're going on a journey to get this train rolling.
I've found job applications take a LONG time to complete. The maximum I'm able to pump out is 10 applications in a day, but that's at the sacrifice of my other preparations.
Since we're on the subject... Let's talk about all that I do in a day to prepare for that sweet sweet interview.

## Resources and My Daily Routine

### Resources:

- [Rands Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
  - This community is FULL of job seekers and hiring managers. It's a great place for support, advice and just to be around people who are going through the same thing.
    There's even a job posting channel! But you know, _not a staff or senior engineer just yet..._
- [Otta](https://app.welcometothejungle.com/)
  - This is a great job board for finding jobs that are actually a good fit. I'd say the matching algorithm is pretty good. Probably my favorite so far.
- [Never Search Alone](https://www.phyl.org/)
  - This is another great community resource for getting a Job Search Council. I've just discovered this myself but it's sort of based on local charters so it's likely to be a good fit for local networking.
- LinkedIn
  - I don't think I need to explain but a Premium subscription doesn't seem to do anything for me.
- [Leopard.FYI Resume Guidelines](https://leopard.fyi/blog/leopardfyi-resume-guidelines)
  - This was a resource given to me in Rands Slack. It sets great rules for the construction of your resume
- [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/)
  - I pretty much just hit the homepage on this site to remind me of the order of in which I should be practicing data structures. Great guy, look him up on YouTube by the same name.
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - This shouldn't need much explanation. All you need to know is that you should be practicing these problems even if you're currently employed as a software engineer.
- [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/)
  - Remember to get outside and touch grass. The job search is exhausting.

### My Daily Routine:

I've found it very helpful mentally and productively to have a routine and act like I still have a job. I'm proud to say I have yet to spend a weekday lying on the couch with Cheeto fingers.
Below is an average daily routine. I'm laying this out here as both a reminder to myself and maybe you'll find it useful.

- 9:00am - 10:00am: Handle any LinkedIn messages, respond to emails, and do any other admin work.
- 10:00am - 11:00am: Break for breakfast, time with my wife and take the dog for a wee.
- 11:00am - 1:00pm: Practice data structures and algorithms on Leetcode.
- 1:00pm - 3:00pm: Hammer out some applications. (Focus on the ones that are a good fit first)
- 3:00pm - 5:00pm: Work on my portfolio website and any other side projects. This can also morph into Leetcode or reading profession-relevant books such as "Grokking Algorithms".
- 5:00pm +: break for dinner and whatever else. I'll usually hop back on the train before bed to continue working on side projects or reading. Working on my projects can be meditative, at least when they cooperate...

Thankfully I've had the privilege of being able to spend my full time doing this.

## What's next?

Well, the first thing on my mind is I'm becoming a father! That is projected to happen in early June so I've got some time to get myself employed before that happens but I can't just spend all my time looking for work.
So it's back to the service industry. I've already got a decade of experience and daddy needs to pay the bills. I'm very happy with my new career path as a software engineer and I can't wait to get back to it professionally.

I have a ton to learn and I'm ready to be a valuable contributor to my next team. My past experience clearly shows that I've gotten to where I am today through hard work and thoughtful strategy. I ain't no nepo baby!
What I value most is radical candor, transparency from leadership, and products that bring impactful outcomes for its users.

Looking forward, I'll be sharing more technical posts about what I'm building.
