## What am I doing here?

This is my first time writing for the internet.
My goal for this blog is to serve as a place to reflect, share what I'm working on and document what I've learned.

I don't know where this will go, but I know that out of all the work I've done in my life, coding is what feels like home. This blog will be a place for me to share that with you, dear reader. My goal is to share technical findings and insights from my work, sprinkled with my personality.

Recently, I was laid off. It’s been… well, a disaster. But silver linings are where angels live, right? One silver lining is this blog. I’m coding up a project that makes me happy and turning this challenging period into an opportunity for growth.

In my previous position, I worked hard every day—the kind of work that felt like a tough workout or a boxing match. It was exhausting but rewarding, and I’m proud of everything I accomplished. Reflecting on where I was in November 2022, I realize how much I’ve grown as a software engineer, both in skill and resilience.

## Where I'm at now

Now, I have the time to double down on my existing skills and learn new ones. Most of my days are spent networking, coding, and making myself marketable in a competitive job market.
I’ve got two solid years of experience with Ruby on Rails, React, JavaScript, and SQL, along with other mainstream tools you’ll find on my resume (email me for a copy ;D). However, the market isn’t exactly clamoring for candidates with just two years of experience. So, we’re going on a journey to get this train rolling.

## Resources and My Daily Routine

### Resources:

- [Rands Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/)
  - This community is FULL of job seekers and hiring managers. It's a great place for support, advice and just to be around people who are going through the same thing.
    There's even a job posting channel! But you know, _not a staff or senior engineer just yet..._
- [Otta](https://app.welcometothejungle.com/)
  - This is a great job board for finding jobs that are actually a good fit. I'd say the matching algorithm is above average. Probably my favorite so far.
- [Never Search Alone](https://www.phyl.org/)
  - This is another great community resource for getting a Job Search Council. I've just discovered this myself but it's sort of based on local charters so it's likely to be a good fit for local networking.
- LinkedIn
  - I don't think I need to explain but a Premium subscription doesn't seem to do anything for me.
- [Leopard.FYI Resume Guidelines](https://leopard.fyi/blog/leopardfyi-resume-guidelines)
  - This was a resource given to me in Rands Slack. It sets great rules for the construction of your resume
- [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/)
  - I pretty much just hit the homepage on this site to remind me of the order of in which I should be practicing data structures. Great guy, look him up on YouTube by the same name.
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
  - This shouldn't need much explanation. All you need to know is that you should be practicing these problems even if you're currently employed as a software engineer.
- [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/)
  - Remember to get outside and touch grass. The job search is exhausting.

### My Daily Routine:

I've found it very helpful mentally and productive keep a routine. I'm proud to say I have yet to spend a weekday lying on the couch with Cheeto fingers.

- 9:00am - 10:00am: Handle any LinkedIn messages, respond to emails, and do any other admin work.
- 10:00am - 11:00am: Break for breakfast, time with my wife and take the dog for a wee.
- 11:00am - 1:00pm: Practice data structures and algorithms on Leetcode.
- 1:00pm - 3:00pm: Hammer out some applications. (Focus on the ones that are a good fit first)
- 3:00pm - 5:00pm: Work on my portfolio website and any other side projects. This can also morph into Leetcode or reading profession-relevant books such as "Grokking Algorithms".
- 5:00pm +: break for dinner and whatever else. I'll usually hop back on the train before bed to continue working on side projects or reading. Working on my projects can be meditative, at least when they cooperate...

Thankfully, I have the privilege of dedicating all my time to this.

## What's next?

I’m thrilled to share that I'm becoming a father in June! My immediate priority is finding employment before then.
I may temporarily return to the service industry. I've already got a decade of experience working customer serivce and grocery stores. Hopefully, I can find a software engineering position soon, but daddy has bills to pay. My ultimate goal is to continue growing as a software engineer.

I’ve gotten to where I am today through hard work and forethought, and I’m ready to bring that same energy to my next team. I value radical candor, transparency, and building products that have a real impact on users.

Let’s go on this journey together! Follow along for more updates and technical excursions. I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any advice you’d like to share.
